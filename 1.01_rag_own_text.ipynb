       "AIMessage(content=[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'At its core, **LangChain** is an open-source framework designed to help developers build applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, or Llama.\\n\\nWhile LLMs are powerful on their own, they have limitations: they are \"stateless\" (they don\\'t remember past conversations naturally), they have a cutoff date for their knowledge, and they can\\'t interact with your private data or external tools out of the box. **LangChain acts as the \"glue\"** that connects these models to other sources of data and computation.\\n\\nHere is a breakdown of what LangChain is used for:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\\nThis is the most common use case. LangChain allows you to connect an LLM to your own data (PDFs, databases, emails, or websites).\\n*   **How it works:** When a user asks a question, LangChain searches your documents for the relevant information and feeds that specific info to the LLM to generate an accurate answer.\\n*   **Example:** A company building a chatbot that answers questions based on their internal 500-page employee handbook.\\n\\n### 2. Creating \"Agents\"\\nLangChain allows LLMs to act as \"agents\" that can make decisions about which tools to use to solve a problem.\\n*   **How it works:** You give the LLM access to a suite of tools (like a web search engine, a calculator, or a Python interpreter). The LLM decides which tool is needed to answer the user\\'s prompt.\\n*   **Example:** You ask, \"What is the current stock price of Apple and what is its P/E ratio?\" The agent realizes it needs to search the web for the price and then use a calculator to find the ratio.\\n\\n### 3. Chaining Multiple Tasks\\nAs the name suggests, LangChain is built for \"chaining\" different components together.\\n*   **How it works:** You can create a sequence of events where the output of one step becomes the input for the next.\\n*   **Example:** A chain that: 1. Summarizes a long YouTube transcript $\\\\rightarrow$ 2. Translates that summary into French $\\\\rightarrow$ 3. Formats it into a social media post.\\n\\n### 4. Managing \"Memory\"\\nBy default, LLMs treat every question as a brand-new interaction. They don\\'t \"remember\" what you said two minutes ago unless you send the whole history back to them.\\n*   **How it works:** LangChain provides utilities to store and manage conversation history, allowing for seamless, multi-turn conversations.\\n*   **Example:** A customer support bot that remembers the user\\'s name and the problem they described at the start of the chat.\\n\\n### 5. Model Switching (Interoperability)\\nLangChain provides a standardized interface for many different LLMs.\\n*   **How it works:** If you write your code using LangChain, you can swap out OpenAI’s GPT-4 for Anthropic’s Claude or an open-source model like Llama 3 by changing just one line of code. This prevents \"vendor lock-in.\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Summary of Key Components\\nTo achieve the above, LangChain uses these building blocks:\\n*   **Prompt Templates:** Pre-defined recipes for talking to the LLM.\\n*   **Indexes/Vector Stores:** Efficient ways to store and search through your private data.\\n*   **Output Parsers:** Tools that force the LLM to return data in a specific format (like JSON instead of a paragraph).\\n*   **Connectors:** Built-in integrations for Google Drive, Slack, Wikipedia, SQL databases, etc.\\n\\n### Why use it?\\nWithout LangChain, a developer would have to write hundreds of lines of complex code to handle API calls, data formatting, and memory management. **LangChain reduces that complexity**, allowing developers to build sophisticated AI apps in a fraction of the time.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}], additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-3-flash-preview', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019c4175-d234-7402-993c-fe45381f81c9-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 7, 'output_tokens': 1338, 'total_tokens': 1345, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 499}})"
